abstract = {A graph matching algorithm is illustrated and its performance compared with that of a well known algorithm performing the same task. According to the proposed algorithm the matching process is carried out by using a state space representation: a state represents a partial solution of the matching between two graphs, and a transition between states corresponds to the addition of a new pair of matched nodes. A set of feasibility rules is introduced for pruning states corresponding to partial matching solutions not satisfying the required graph morphism. Results outlining the computational cost reduction achieved by the method are given with reference to a set of randomly generated graphs.},

abstract = {This paper presents a largely improved version of the VF2 algorithm for the Subgraph Isomorphism Problem. The improvements are twofold. Firstly, it is based on a new approach for determining the matching order of the nodes, and secondly, more efficient — nevertheless easier to compute — cutting rules are proposed. They together reduce the search space significantly. In addition to the usual Subgraph Isomorphism Problem, the paper also presents specialized algorithms for the Induced Subgraph Isomorphism and for the Graph Isomorphism Problems. Finally, an extensive experimental evaluation is provided using a wide range of inputs, including both real-life biological and chemical datasets and standard randomly generated graph series. The results show major and consistent running time improvements over the other known methods. The C++ implementations of the algorithms are available open-source as part of the LEMON graph and network optimization library.},

Far from providing a definite answer to that question, in this paper we will try to characterize the role that graphs play within the Pattern Recognition field. To this aim two taxonomies are presented and discussed. The first includes almost all the graph matching algorithms proposed from the late seventies, and describes the different classes of algorithms. The second taxonomy considers the types of common applications of graph-based techniques in the Pattern Recognition and Machine Vision field.},

abstract = {Currently, a huge amount of biological data can be naturally rep-resented by graphs, e.g., protein interaction networks, gene reg-ulatory networks, etc. The need for indexing large graphs is an urgent research problem of great practical importance. The main challenge is size. Each graph may contain thousands (or more) ver-tices. Most of the previous work focuses on indexing a set of small or medium sized database graphs (with only tens of vertices) and finding whether a query graph occurs in any of these. In this paper, we are interested in finding all the matches of a query graph in a given large graph of thousands of vertices, which is a very impor-tant task in many biological applications. This increases the com-plexity significantly. We propose a novel distance measurement which reintroduces the idea of frequent substructures in a single large graph. We devise the novel structure distance based approach (GADDI) to efficiently find matches of the query graph. GADDI is further optimized by the use of a dynamic matching scheme to minimize redundant calculations. Last but not least, a number of real and synthetic data sets are used to evaluate the efficiency and scalability of our proposed method.},

abstract = {© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.Subgraph isomorphism is a common problem in several application fields where graphs are the best suited data representation, but it is known to be an NP-Complete problem. However, several algorithms exist that are fast enough on commonly encountered graphs so as to be practically usable; among them, for more than a decade VF2 has been the state of the art algorithm used to solve this problem and it is still the reference algorithm for many applications. Nevertheless, VF2 has been designed and implemented ten years ago when the structural features of the commonly used graphs were considerably different. Hence a renovation is required to make the algorithm able to compete in the challenges arisen in the last years, such as the use of graph matching on the very large graphs coming from bioinformatics applications. In this paper we propose a significant set of enhancements to the original VF2 algorithm that enable it to compete with more recently proposed graph matching techniques. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of these enhancement by comparing the matching performance both with the original VF2 and with several recent algorithms, using both the widely known MIVIA graph database and another public graph dataset containing real-world graphs from bioinformatics applications.},

abstract = {This paper describes a framework for performing relational graph matching using genetic search. There are three novel ingredients to the work. Firstly, we cast the optimisation process into a Bayesian framework by exploiting the recently reported global consistency measure of Wilson and Hancock as a fitness measure. The second novel idea is to realise the crossover process at the level of subgraphs, rather than employing string-based or random crossover. Finally, we accelerate convergence by employing a deterministic hill-climbing process prior to selection. Since we adopt the Bayesian consistency measure as a fitness function, the basic measure of relational distance underpinning the technique is Hamming distance. Our standpoint is that genetic search provides a more attractive means of performing stochastic discrete optimisation on the global consistency measure than alternatives such as simulated annealing. Moreover, the action of the optimisation process is easily understood in terms of its action in the Hamming distance domain. We demonstrate empirically not only that the method possesses polynomial convergence time but also that the convergence rate is more rapid than simulated annealing. We provide some experimental evaluation of the method in the matching of aerial stereograms and evaluate its sensitivity on synthetically generated graphs. © 1997 Pattern Recognition Society.

We define a similarity matrix whose (i, j)-th real entry expresses how similar vertex j (in G\_A) is to vertex i (in G\_B. The similarity matrix can be obtained as the limit of the normalized even iterates of a linear transformation. In the special case where G\_A=G\_B=G, the matrix is square and the (i, j)-th entry is the similarity score between the vertices i and j of G. We point out that Kleinberg's "hub and authority" method to identify web-pages relevant to a given query can be viewed as a special case of our definition in the case where one of the graphs has two vertices and a unique directed edge between them. In analogy to Kleinberg, we show that our similarity scores are given by the components of a dominant eigenvector of a non-negative matrix. Potential applications of our similarity concept are numerous. We illustrate an application for the automatic extraction of synonyms in a monolingual dictionary.},
